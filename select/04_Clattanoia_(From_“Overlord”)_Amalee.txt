The answer, where is it now?
Seek it out!
Where’s my soul?
It’s like a nightmare that I’m living every morning
When I wake up, only bones are what remain
I’m in a panic! Get out, hurry
Oh, there are mysteries and then miseries
Dead or alive, I’m being led across a thin line
As I wander my way right into Hell
An invitation.. with no emotion
I dance, 1-2-3 steps on this dark stage
Raise your flag - March on, fight
Reaching for this mask of mine
As a shiver cold as ice is clawing down my spine
Wars and swords - Tears and blood
Suddenly I start to laugh
And I just can’t seem to hold it back
The answer, where is it now?
Seek it out!
Where’s my soul?
Where’s my heart?
Lost myself in this reality
Don’t hesitate - Go this way
‘Cause I don’t know and I don’t care
Even if turns from dream to nightmare
I will keep surviving
From the darkness I’ll emerge
Ah, the pain that left you breathless
Comes back with a vengeance
In this cold, miserable world
The sky grows darker, losing light when it hits midnight
Pitch black darkness, it always drives me mad
Where is that star now?
I found the star now
But it’s so beautiful
I’m so doubtful
Between bewilderment and passion lies desire
When I look out, I see sky, land, and sea
It is temptation … For domination
I climb 1-2-3 steps to the royal throne
Cast a spell - Call them up
Summoning utter despair
As my soldiers dance, drunk on the bloodlust in the air
Shouts and barks - Grief and death
Raise your blades along with me,
With the world cowering at our feet!
Stay cruel until the end
And descend
Break it all, take it all
Everything you see is yours take
I just pray – or just play?
But that’s not it, I just can’t quit
All the doubt is causing me to lose it
Take back what was lost
Everything that belongs to us
Even if it’s full of malice
Drowning in its madness,
In this cold and crazy world
A heart’s missing … In this body
Flesh and bones are laid bare for all to see
I’ll take an oath… Swear on my soul
Everything that I believe
The answer, just toss it out!
And run now!
Where’s my soul?
Where’s my heart?
Put your faith in your will to survive
Don’t hesitate – Go this way
‘Cause I don’t know - I don’t care
Even if turns from dream to nightmare
I’ll just keep surviving
From the darkness I’ll emerge
And I’ll keep running on my feet
Far as they will take me
In this cold, miserable world
