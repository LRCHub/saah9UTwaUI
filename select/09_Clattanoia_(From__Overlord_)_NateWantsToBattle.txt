Can someone give me the answer
To my question?
Where's my soul?

It's like a virus in my body while I'm dreaming
When I wake up, all that's left of me are bones
I'm in a panic, get out, hurry
Oh, there are mysteries and many miseries

Dead or alive, I'm on the brink of self-destruction
As I'm roaming from left and right to hell
An invitation to come disappear
We're dancing one, two, three steps on this dark stage

Raise your flag, march on, fight
Break your mask and show some pride
While this war just sends a shiver down my crooked spine
Wars and swords, tears and blood
Feel my heart begin to race
As I laugh in this bloodbath we made

Can someone give me the answer
To my question?
Where's my soul?
Where's my heart?
Am I losing my own self?
Don't you hesitate
Go this way
I don't know
And I don't care
Tell me, are you not entertained now?

I'll just keep surviving
I just cannot hide at all (can't hide at all)
I am not to fall a victim
I'll continue living
In this misery driven world

See, the sky is black and biting cold at midnight
The dark's consuming, it always drives me mad
Where is the star now?
I found the star now
But if it's so beautiful
I am now full of doubt

Amid bewilderment and lies, a deep desire
When I look out, it's sky and land and sea
That deep desire to climb even higher
I'm climbing one, two, three steps to the royal throne

Cast the spell, call them up
Summon them with all despair
Drunk with emptiness, my soldiers, who all lose and dance
Shouts and barks, grief and death
Cower all day under fear
As you bow before my mighty blade

Well that's what you get
All you did
Break it all
Take it all
Everything is for the taking now
I'll just pray
Or just play
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I'm addicted to all this power

I'll just keep on winning
Nothing will be left at all (left at all)
I am not to fall a victim
I'll continue diving
In my misery driven world

I can see
Just what you're made of
Bear your soul with your heart on your sleeve
Fighting for
What you believe in
Now's your chance to prove yourself

Can someone give me the answer
To my question?
Where's my soul?
Where's my heart?
Am I losing my own self?
Don't you hesitate
Go this way
I don't know
And I don't care
Tell me, are you not entertained now?

I'll just keep surviving
I just cannot hide at all (can't hide at all)
I am not to fall a victim
I'll continue living in
This misery driven world
